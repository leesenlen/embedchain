To add any pdf file, use the data_type as `pdf_file`. Eg:

```python
from embedchain import App

app = App()

app.add('https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf', data_type='pdf_file')
app.query("What is the paper 'attention is all you need' about?", citations=True)
# Answer: The paper "Attention Is All You Need" proposes a new network architecture called the Transformer, which is based solely on attention mechanisms. It suggests that complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks can be replaced with a simpler architecture that connects the encoder and decoder through attention. The paper discusses how this approach can improve sequence transduction models, such as neural machine translation.
