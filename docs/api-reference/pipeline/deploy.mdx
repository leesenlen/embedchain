title: 🚀 deploy

Using the `deploy()` method, Embedchain allows developers to easily launch their LLM-powered applications on the [Embedchain Platform](https://app.embedchain.ai). This platform facilitates seamless access to your data's context via a free and user-friendly REST API. Once your pipeline is deployed, you can update your data sources at any time.

The `deploy()` method not only deploys your pipeline but also efficiently manages LLMs, vector databases, embedding models, and data syncing, enabling you to focus on querying, chatting, or searching without the hassle of infrastructure management.

## Usage

```python
from embedchain import App

# Initialize app
app = App()

# Add data source
app.add("https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk")

# Deploy your pipeline to Embedchain Platform
app.deploy()

# 🔑 Enter your Embedchain API key. You can find the API key at https://app.embedchain.ai/settings/keys/
# ec-xxxxxx
