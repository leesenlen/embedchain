description: 'Deploy your RAG application to production'
---

After successfully setting up and testing your RAG app locally, the next step is to deploy it to a hosting service to make it accessible to a wider audience. Embedchain provides integration with different cloud providers so that you can seamlessly deploy your RAG applications to production without having to worry about going through the cloud provider instructions. Embedchain does all the heavy lifting for you.

## Self-hosting

You can also deploy Embedchain as a self-hosted service using the dockerized REST API service that we provide. Please follow the [guide here](/examples/rest-api) on how to use the REST API service. Here are some tutorials on how to deploy a containerized application to different platforms like AWS, GCP, Azure etc:
