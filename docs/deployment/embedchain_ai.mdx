## Deploy on Embedchain Platform

Embedchain enables developers to deploy their LLM-powered apps in production using the [Embedchain platform](https://app.embedchain.ai). The platform offers free access to context on your data through its REST API. Once the pipeline is deployed, you can update your data sources anytime after deployment.

See the example below on how to use the deploy your app (for free):

```python
from embedchain import App

# Initialize app
app = App()

# Add data source
app.add("https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk")

# Deploy your pipeline to Embedchain Platform
app.deploy()

# 🔑 Enter your Embedchain API key. You can find the API key at https://app.embedchain.ai/settings/keys/
# ec-xxxxxx

# 🛠️ Creating pipeline on the platform...
# 🎉🎉🎉 Pipeline created successfully! View your pipeline: https://app.embedchain.ai/pipelines/xxxxx
